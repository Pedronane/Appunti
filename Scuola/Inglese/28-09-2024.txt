I enjoy my life, I dont do much in my days but I like it.
I'd like to play more games and watch more shows that I missed.
I dont have much time to spend on things that i want to do because i play too much videogames but is not a big deal.
My gf says that i dont socialize much but idc.
I want a bigger bedroom, so when my sister is going to move out im going to take her bedroom.
